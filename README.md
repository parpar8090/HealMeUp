# HealMeUp
HealMeUp is a plugin for Spigot-MC servers that heals players whenever they are out of combat.

It was insipired by this [post](https://www.mc-market.org/threads/685665/#post-4909520) on MC-Market.
I made this project because I wanted to boost my coding skills as well as seeing if I can do it within a given timeframe. 
In this project, I was given 2 days to complete, but I just finished it in about 5 hours.
